**SCOPE**:

This project describes a new, emerging way to shed light on a complex dataset and to communicate the findings with a broad audience. We begin this process with some missing data analysis, then create interactive visualizations and embed them into a power bi dashboard. We illustrate the concepts using data from a Call Center!. Our findings uncover interesting patterns, both qualitative and quantitative. In this paper, we describe in detail the process by which we explored the data and built the visualizations that underlie that work.


**DATA AND FINDINGS:**

The initial dataset, included qualitative data on over 120,000  incoming calls data. It had data on the Agent details, call duration, call occurring date, status of the call and other factors.

In our missing data analysis phase, we found several interesting results. For example, we found that the missing data is actually required for the further predictive analysis on man power planning, on further analysis we have found that most answered calls are between 10am-1pm where as very less calls are handled during night from 8pm which resulted in bad customer experience. Abandon calls rate is 30%.Man power planning is done to achieve 10% abandon rate.

**APPROACH**:

In order to analyze the call center data and generate insights out of it, we followed the process that looked at the data using the following visualizations:

Missing data analysis using missingno python module
Exploratory Data Analysis using Power Bi and Python
man power planning predictive analysis.
Pie and column Chart
Exploring the duration data
Area Chart for average duration
